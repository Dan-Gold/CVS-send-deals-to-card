# CVS-send-deals-to-card
Neither CVS.com nor the app has an add all deals to card button and going through adding all of CVS's weekly deals to your card is a hassle. This tool is attempting to automate the process so all you need to do is click run and log into your account.


Note: Theoretically this tool works, but my browser is blocked. I know the login process works, all of the navigation works, and my offline testing of adding the deals to your card works.
